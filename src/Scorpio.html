			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>The mysterious sign of the zodiac. They can be obsessive and destructive; in the land of love, there is no
				grey
				area, no black and white. They are very clear about their goals, and once they set them, they move forward.
			</p>
			<p>Scorpio people have a strong sixth sense, mysterious ability to see and attract, often by intuition;
				although
				they have a keen observation, but often still rely on the feeling to decide everything.</p>
			<p>Scorpio personality is strong and uncompromising, also very aggressive, which is a self-required
				self-transcendence to constantly fill the deepest desires of the heart. Because of this, the Scorpion always
				has a goal in mind and is very persistent, with an indomitable fighting spirit and fighting power, moving
				thoughtfully towards the goal. Because they are a water sign, they are emotionally sensitive, but they are
				self-centered and ignore the opinions of others. </p>
			<p>In short, Scorpio is a subtle and complex "hybrid" with a strong sense of responsibility, resilience,
				conceptualization, organization, strong will, strong desire to dominate, a unique instinct for the mysteries
				of
				life, and always a lot of energy.</p>
