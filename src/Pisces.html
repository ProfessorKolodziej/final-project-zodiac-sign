			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>For Pisces, they are both emotional and rational in their relationships. Pisces will involuntarily fall
				into
				the beautiful fantasy of feelings and indulge in it while enjoying happiness. Once the fantasy is
				broken,
				they
				will collapse again, and then despair. But once they regain their sanity, they will become very
				unfeeling
				and
				will no longer be nostalgic for this relationship.</p>
