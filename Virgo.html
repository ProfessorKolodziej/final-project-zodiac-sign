Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express it, but because they won't accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.</p></div><div class="tt"><img src="20dc2dab822137f0bdea.webp"></div><div class="gold"><h3>Lucky elements</h3><ul><li>Lucky Color: Grey, Beige</li><li>Day: Wednesday</li><li>Lucky Number: 15,23,32</li><li>Lucky Stone: Carnelian</li></ul></div><div class="gold"><h3>Match Zodiac</h3><p>Pisces, Cancer</p><div class="goldimg"><a href="Pisces.html"><p><img src="221c794c46bde64b8b94.webp"></p><p>Pisces</p></a><a href="Cancer.html"><p><img src="70ffd06ad50f1aa223aa.webp"></p><p>Cancer</p></a></div></div><div class="grid"><div class="bom"><h3>Strength</h3><p>Virgo pursues perfection, never discourages, is down-to-earth, cautious, careful, good at collecting information, hardworking, keeping duty, reliable, humble and not exaggerating, with precise observation, patience, faithful to love, humble, liking Neat, careful, clear-headed, and analytical, able to distinguish right from wrong.</p></div><div class="bom"><h3>Weakness</h3><p>Virgo is too fastidious, nagging, trivial, unreasonably worried, poor and nervous, self-sufficient, has a tendency to cleanliness, lacks the elegance of accepting criticism, is not romantic enough, does not respect other people's dreams, interpersonal relationships need to be strengthened, too practical, and lacks Foresight, like picking the bones in the egg, too demanding to be critical, sentimental, fussy, old-fashioned, and hard to please.</p></div></div></section></body></html>
