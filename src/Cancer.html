			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>Cancer is very serious in relationships. If you are strong, Cancer will be stronger. If you are willing
				to
				give
				Cancer gentleness, then Cancer will definitely give you gentleness back.Cancer is very easy to
				substitute
				their
				own positive or negative emotions into the relationship. Although it seems Cancer will actively guide
				the
				speed
				of a relationship because of their emotions, in fact Cancer is very passive. They are getting easily
				influenced
				by their partner. Expressing your tenderness and love will give Cancer positive guidance.
